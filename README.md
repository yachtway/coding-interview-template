# YachtWay Coding Interview Starter Template
You will find a generic `frontend` and `backend` application here. Familiarize yourself with the technology listed if you don't already know them. Prior knowledge is not required and how you deal with technologies you don't fully know yet will be taken into account if applicable. Make sure you're able to get everything up and running!

We will be using this to build a full-stack app together. Hopefully it'll be a fun time. You will be able to look up any documentation or guides as needed on Google. The only thing that's not allowed is ChatGPT (or any similar LLM).
